This circulation moved toward the west-northwest and intensified over the next few days. The strengthening was such that on the evening of November 3 the National Weather Service Office in Guam started issuing Special Weather Statements on it. At that time it was still a tropical disturbance and was located near 6N156E or 95 miles west of Pohnpei. Further intensification resulted in the disturbance reaching tropical depression strength. On the night of November 3rd the first advisory was issued for Tropical Depression 31W when it was located near 6N155E. Even though it was only a depression it was expected to quickly intensify. This expectation was borne out as the depression became a tropical storm on the afternoon of the 4th and a typhoon by the afternoon of the 5th. Haiyan, as the system was named was located near 6N145E as it attained typhoon strength. This intensification did not cease as Haiyan became a super typhoon on the afternoon of the 6th. The location of Haiyan at that time was near 8N139E or 300 miles east of Koror Palau. Haiayn had maximum sustained winds of 150 mph with gust estimated to be near 175 mph. On the evening|of the 6th it passed very close to the atoll of Ngulu. The storm surge generated by |Haiyan overspread the atoll. The atoll was inhabited by only six people, none of these|were evacuated. Despite the devastation caused by the storm surge, all of these people survived.|     As Haiyan continued its trek westward its eye passed over Kayangel on the morning of the 7th. The population of this atoll at that time was around 100 people with 30 of them being evacuated to Koror before the typhoon arrived. Most of these evacuees were elderly, women and children. 69 people remained on Kayangel as the eye of Haiyan passed over it. The super typhoon's destructive winds severely damaged|the atoll's only school and clinic. In addtion, roofs of most of the houses on Kayangel were blown off. Many trees were toppled by the strong winds. Power lines as well as communication lines were totally damaged. Storm surge associated with Haiyan pushed sea water inland, contaminating planting fields and the atoll's fresh water lens. The spoiling of the lens means that the people of Kayangel will have to import fresh water|from Palau. Eventually it is hoped that a water desalinization plant will be installed to produce drinking water. |     It could cost the Palauan government $10 million to rebuild power and water infrastructure, as well schools and homes. Despite the intensity of the typhoon and the damage it incurred, no deaths were reported.","Haiyan crossed Micronesia from November 3rd to the 7th.",2

The highest sustained wind recorded at the Vero Beach Municipal Airport was 55 mph from the northwest at 0150LST on October 7 and the peak gust was 74 mph from the west at 0251LST. Wind damage occurred to more than two dozen homes, mainly a result of trees falling onto roofs. Three homes were destroyed, 15 sustained major damage, seven experienced minor damage and an additional seven homes were affected in some way. Other minor damage occurred to garage doors, car ports, fences and pool screen enclosures. Preliminary property damage was estimated at $15.8 million. A total of 1,297 residents evacuated to shelters within the county.  No injuries or fatalities were reported.","Major Hurricane Matthew moved northwest from the eastern tip to Cuba, reaching the extreme western coast of Grand Bahama Island during the evening of October 6 at Category 4 strength. The hurricane continued northwest and was centered approximately 55 miles east of Stuart at 2300LST. Matthew then paralleled the Florida coast, remaining just offshore as a Category 3 hurricane. The eye reached its closest point of approach to land, only 25 miles east of Cape Canaveral near 0800LST on October 7, and was 35 miles east of Daytona Beach around 1100LST, as it continued moving northwest, just offshore the northeast Florida coast. Hurricane force winds (sustained or frequent gusts) affected coastal areas from Vero Beach northward, extending inland across the mainland portions of Brevard and Volusia Counties, with tropical storm force winds experienced across much of the remainder of east-central Florida. The strongest winds occurred along the coast from Cape Canaveral in Brevard County to north or Ormond-By-The-Sea in Volusia County, where Category 1-2 winds were likely experienced. Two direct hurricane-related fatalities and one direct injury occurred, in addition to nine indirect deaths. Preliminary damage estimates across east-central Florida exceeded $580 million, with $514 million reported in Volusia County alone.||A storm surge of 3-6 feet affected the beaches from near the Indian River/St. Lucie County line northward to the Volusia/Flagler County line, along with moderate to major beach erosion, with the highest surge (5-6 feet) and most significant erosion occurring north of Daytona Beach. Farther south, a surge of 2-3 feet occurred, along with minor to moderate beach erosion.  ||Rainfall totals reached 7-9 inches across parts of Seminole and Volusia Counties, where widespread flooding of streets and low-lying areas occurred.

A NWS damage survey confirmed that sustained category 1-2 hurricane winds likely occurred along the coastline from Cape Canaveral northward. The highest sustained wind recorded at the Melbourne International Airport was 53 mph from the north at 0146LST on October 7 and the peak gust was 70 mph from the northwest at 0257LST. A USAF wind sensor at 54 feet above ground level near the beach north of Cape Canaveral recorded a sustained wind of 79 mph and a gust of 107 mph. Other recorded peak wind gusts included 87 mph at Satellite Beach, 81 mph on Merritt Island and 77 mph at Cocoa Beach. Wind damage occurred to several hundred homes, often a result of impacts due to falling trees.  Eleven homes were destroyed, 140 sustained major damage, 549 experienced minor damage and an additional 1,500 homes were affected in some way. Structural damage to homes and businesses due to wind were confined mainly to the barrier islands as well as those properties exposed to larger bodies of water. Damage generally involved roof shingles, soffits, awnings, and pool enclosures. Further inland, property damage was mainly a result of fallen trees, especially to older buildings and mobile homes near wooded areas. Several homes experienced water intrusion due to damaged roofs. Two homes were lost to fire as officials suspended emergency services during the height of the storm. County-wide, there was sporadic damage to fences, awnings, and screen rooms. About 227,000 customers were without power at the height of the storm, or about 75 percent of the county. Preliminary property damage was estimated at $35 million to residential structures and $40 million to public structures. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for residents of the barrier islands, including Merritt Island, as well as low-lying areas, RV parks, and mobile homes across the remainder of the county. A total of 4,320 residents evacuated to shelters within the county.  There was one direct injury. A male in his 40s was injured in Port Canaveral when a sign fell and struck him during the storm.","Major Hurricane Matthew moved northwest from the eastern tip to Cuba, reaching the extreme western coast of Grand Bahama Island during the evening of October 6 at Category 4 strength. The hurricane continued northwest and was centered approximately 55 miles east of Stuart at 2300LST. Matthew then paralleled the Florida coast, remaining just offshore as a Category 3 hurricane. The eye reached its closest point of approach to land, only 25 miles east of Cape Canaveral near 0800LST on October 7, and was 35 miles east of Daytona Beach around 1100LST, as it continued moving northwest, just offshore the northeast Florida coast. Hurricane force winds (sustained or frequent gusts) affected coastal areas from Vero Beach northward, extending inland across the mainland portions of Brevard and Volusia Counties, with tropical storm force winds experienced across much of the remainder of east-central Florida. The strongest winds occurred along the coast from Cape Canaveral in Brevard County to north or Ormond-By-The-Sea in Volusia County, where Category 1-2 winds were likely experienced. Two direct hurricane-related fatalities and one direct injury occurred, in addition to nine indirect deaths.

A NWS damage survey confirmed that sustained category 1 hurricane winds likely occurred along portions of the coastline. The highest sustained wind recorded at the Daytona Beach International Airport was 52 mph from the north at 0545LST on October 7 and the peak gust was 71 mph from the north at 0711LST. Other recorded peak wind gusts included 84 mph at Embry-Riddle University in Daytona Beach and 83 mph at New Smyrna Beach. Wind damage occurred to several thousand homes, often a result of impacts due to falling trees.  Sixty-nine homes were destroyed, 467 sustained major damage, 1,494 experienced minor damage and an additional 10,041 homes were affected in some way. Structural damage to homes and businesses due to wind were mainly confined to the barrier islands as well as those properties exposed to larger bodies of water. Damage to the roofs of older buildings was more notable than newer construction, where damage was generally confined to roof shingles, soffits, awnings, and pool enclosures. Further inland, property damage was mainly a result of fallen trees, especially to older buildings and mobile homes within densely wooded areas.  At the peak of the storm, nearly 258,000 customers were without power, or 92% of the county.  Preliminary property damage was estimated at $514.4 million. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for all of the barrier islands, as well as low-lying areas, RV parks, and mobile homes across the remainder of the county. A total of 4,000 residents evacuated to shelters within the county.  One direct fatality and four indirect fatalities resulted from the hurricane. A 63-year-old woman died on October 7 during the hurricane when a tree fell on her as she was feeding animals outside her Deland home. On October 10, an 87-year-old man was electrocuted by a downed power line in Deleon Springs around 0700LST. Also on this date, a 9-year-old Daytona Beach boy was found unconscious in his home after officials discovered a generator running in another room. The boy later died from carbon monoxide poisoning at a local medical center. A 47-year-old Ohio man assisting with debris cleanup efforts in Ormond Beach was killed on October 10 when part of a downed tree rolled on top of him and pinned him underneath. On October 14 around 1000LST, a 52-year old tree trimmer died after he was electrocuted while cleaning up storm debris in a Deltona backyard.","Major Hurricane Matthew moved northwest from the eastern tip to Cuba, reaching the extreme western coast of Grand Bahama Island during the evening of October 6 at Category 4 strength.

Matthew then became a hurricane about 190 miles northeast of Curacao on September 29th before reaching Category 5 strength the following day. Matthew then weakened slightly while turning north toward the Greater Antilles, remaining a Category 4 hurricane as it made landfall over Haiti���s Tiburon Peninsula early on October 4th. Matthew then continued north while maintaining a Category 4 strength before making a second landfall near the Guantanamo Province in Cuba later that day.

Wind gusts were in excess of 100 mph over most areas, particularly in the western half of the county near the eye wall. Heavy tree and power pole damage, along with minor structural damage, was observed in areas affected by the eye wall. Post-storm survey revealed the likelihood of mini-vortices in the eastern eye wall causing enhanced tree and structural damage in the Orangetree and Corkscrew Swamp area. Total number of damaged structures,   damage estimates, death toll and customers without power are included in the Coastal Collier County entry.","Major Hurricane Irma made landfall in Southwest Florida on Marco Island as a Category 3 hurricane around 330 PM EDT on September 10th. The storm traveled north through southwest Florida through the evening. Effects from Irma were felt across South Florida from September 9th through September 11th. Irma had reached Category 5 strength and a minimum central pressure of 914 MB east of the Bahamas, maintaining Category 5 intensity until landfall along the north coast of Cuba on September 9th. Irma made its first Florida landfall in the Lower Florida Keys early on September 10th as a Category 4 hurricane. ||The strength and size of Hurricane Irma allowed for impacts to be felt across all of South Florida. Irma brought widespread wind damage, heavy rainfall and storm surge to all areas. Hurricane-force sustained wind were measured in much of Collier County, as well as far southern and inland Miami-Dade County, with the possibility of additional hurricane-force sustained wind in more isolated areas over the remainder of South Florida where widespread tropical storm force sustained wind occurred. Gusts to hurricane force were felt over all of South Florida, with the maximum measured wind gust of 142 mph in Naples in Collier County. Widespread tree damage and some structural damage occurred across all of South Florida, with most structural damage on the minor side.||Irma brought a significant storm surge on both coasts of South Florida. Storm surge of 6 to 8 feet was observed in the Everglades City and Goodland areas of Collier County, with 3 to 5 feet from Marco Island to Naples. Along the east coast, observed storm surge values of 4 to 6 feet were noted along Biscayne Bay from south of Miami to Homestead, and 2 to 4 feet elsewhere along the east coast from Key Biscayne to Palm Beach.||Hurricane Irma brought widespread rainfall and some flooding across the region. From the period between 8 AM EDT September 9th and 8 AM EDT September 11th, 8 to 15 inches of rain were measured over interior portions of Southwest Florida, with estimated amounts of 16 to 20 inches in southwestern Hendry County. This rainfall near the end of a wet summer led to significant flooding over these areas. 5 to 10 inches of rain were noted elsewhere across South Florida, with areas of minor to moderate flooding. ||32 deaths were attributed to Irma in southern Florida, all but one indirect. The only direct death was an 86-year-old man who was knocked down by a gust of wind while opening the front door of his home in Broward County. Most of the deaths occurred during cleanup after the storm, as well as several as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning from misuse of generators.

By the afternoon of the 7th the disturbance was classified as Tropical Depression 26W north of Kwajalein. By the morning of September 8th, 26W had intensified into Tropical Storm Mangkhut and was located 130 miles north-northeast of Enewetak. After further strengthening, Mangkhut became a typhoon by the afternoon of September 9th. The typhoon continued to move towards the Marianas and on 10 September the 21-mile-wide eye of Mangkhut passed over Rota about 30 miles to the northeast between 1700 and 1900 ChST. Despite moving away from the Marianas, Magkhut's continued intensification caused winds to decrease rather slowly over the islands. Even though it passed over Rota, the highest sustained wind and highest gust were not observed there, but over northern Guam at Andersen AFB. At Andersen, the winds reached 67 mph with a gust to 87 mph at 2101 ChST (1101Z) on the 10th. On Rota the highest wind observed was 58 mph with a gust to 82 mph between 1600 and 1700 ChST, although winds probably were higher than this over southern parts of Rota as the eye moved over that island. The remote observing system at the airport became inoperative after reporting the peak observation. The airport is located on the northern part of the island while the major population center is on the southern part of the island. There is no observing equipment there, but that location likely experienced the stronger winds. At the time of passage over Rota, Mangkhut was a Category 2 typhoon so sustained winds should have reached near 100 mph. Maximum estimated rainfall was recorded over Guam at Andersen AFB with 9 inches. Rota only measured 1.13 inches but this is in error as the recording rain gauge had no reports after 1800 ChST (08Z) as the the eye wall passed over the island. Rainfall reports in inches on Guam were: Umatic Rain Gauge (RG): 8.46 Almagosa RG near Santa Rita: 10.15 Fena RG at the Reservoir Pump Station, near Santa Rita: 9.1 Windward Hills RG near Talofofo: 7.89 Mount Chachao RG near Nimitz Hill, Piti: 7.74 Dededo RG near Dededo-Yigo boundary: 10.11 Mt. Santa Rosa RG near Pagat, Mangilao: 8.07 Geomag Observatory RG, Andersen AFB, Guam: 10.86 On Guam 1500 people had gone to the shelters, with shelters across northern Guam filled to capacity. As the storms passed over Rota, the strongest winds on Guam were over the northern half. These stronger winds destroyed or heavily damaged many of the tin and wood houses over the northern section of Guam. The typhoon temporarily knocked out 80 percent of the power on Guam, with 100 percent of the power knocked out on Rota. 662 families took to the shelters on Rota and only 76 families did the same on Tinian and Saipan. Preliminary estimates of infrastructure and repair costs were $4.3 million for Guam, and $3.3 million for Rota, Tinian, and Saipan.","Typhoon Mangkhut passed across the Marianas Sept 10th and 11th.",106

Extremely heavy rainfall across the county initially lead to flash flooding with numerous roads that were impassable.  The Newport River for the first time in recent history overflowed its banks and inundated many homes and businesses near the river.  Over 400 water rescues were reported in the county, most of which were along and near the Newport River. US 70 was closed in numerous spots between Havelock and Morehead City due to floodwaters rushing over the roadway.  Gusty northeast winds developed ahead of Florence as the storm approached the coast, with a peak wind gust of 106 mph at Cape Lookout at 617 LST on September 13th and a 105 mph gust at Fort Macon at 723 PM EST on September 13th.  The gusty winds combined with saturated ground led to many downed trees with widespread power outages.  Preliminary storm surge values (above ground level) of 2 to 3 feet were found in Morehead City and Atlantic Beach, with 2 to 4 feet above ground level found in Salty Shores (Newport) and Cedar Key.  2.7 feet of storm surge was found along Goose Creek.  Nearby it was estimated around 3 feet of surge covered highway 24 near the Town of Bogue, and closed the roadway on September 14th near high tide. NWS storm survey confirmed a EF 1 tornado occurred at Open Grounds Farms. Several outbuildings and large silos were damaged. Maximum winds were estimated at 100 to 110 mph. NWS storm survey confirmed a EF 1 tornado touched down near Davis on 9/14 at 1101 EST. Maximum estimated winds were around 90 mph. NWS storm survey confirmed a EF 1 tornado occurred near Otway on 9/14 at 1215 EST in rural Eastern Carteret County. Maximum estimated winds were around 100 mph. NWS storm survey confirmed a EF 1 tornado 2 miles northeast of Stella on 9/14 at 2128 EST in Carteret County and White Oak township in southern Jones county.  Maximum estimated winds were around 100 mph.","Hurricane Florence was a long-lived Cape Verde hurricane and the wettest tropical cyclone on record in the Carolinas. The sixth named storm, third hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2018 Atlantic hurricane season, Florence originated from a strong tropical wave that emerged off the west coast of Africa on August 30, 2018. Florence became a tropical depression near Cape Verde on August 31 and progressed west-northwest, becoming a Tropical Storm on September 1. Florence strengthened rapidly on September 4���5, becoming a Category 4 storm on the Saffir-Simpson wind scale with maximum sustained winds of 130 mph. Florence weakened to a tropical storm by September 7, but the system regained hurricane strength on September 9 and major hurricane status with winds of 140 mph on September 10. However, increasing wind shear caused the storm's winds to gradually weaken over the next few days. However, the storm's wind field continued to grow. By the evening of September 13, Florence had been downgraded to a Category 1 hurricane. Hurricane Florence made landfall near Wrightsville Beach early on Saturday September 15, and weakened further as it slowly moved inland.||Florence produced extensive wind damage along the North Carolina coast from Cape Lookout, across Carteret, Onslow, Pender and New Hanover counties. Thousands of downed trees caused widespread power outages to nearly all of eastern North Carolina. The historic legacy of Hurricane Florence will be record breaking storm surge of 9 to 13 feet and widespread devastating rainfall of 20 to 30 inches, locally up to 36 inches, which produced catastrophic and life-threatening flooding.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available.  There were 7 direct fatalities in the Florida panhandle and 1 direct fatality in southwest Georgia.  ||1. 44 year old male - Gadsden County - died due to trauma following a tree falling on a home (wind).|2. 67 year old male - Jackson County - tree collapsed on mobile home and roof collapsed on deceased (wind).|3. 87 year old male - Bay County - house was swept away during the storm and body was found three blocks from the house (surge).|4. 79 year old female - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach - moved by storm surge (surge).|5. 60 year old female - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach - move by storm surge and found in the rubble - complications from surge and wind (given location, went with surge).|6. 65 year old male - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach rubble - moved by storm surge (surge).|7. 70 year old male - Gulf County - found in debris in Cape San Blas - was fleeing in truck - ruled a drowing (surge).|8.  11 year old female ��� Seminole county, GA.

Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available.  There were 7 direct fatalities in the Florida panhandle and 1 direct fatality in southwest Georgia.  ||1. 44 year old male - Gadsden County - died due to trauma following a tree falling on a home (wind).|2. 67 year old male - Jackson County - tree collapsed on mobile home and roof collapsed on deceased (wind).|3. 87 year old male - Bay County - house was swept away during the storm and body was found three blocks from the house (surge).|4. 79 year old female - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach - moved by storm surge (surge).|5. 60 year old female - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach - move by storm surge and found in the rubble - complications from surge and wind (given location, went with surge).|6. 65 year old male - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach rubble - moved by storm surge (surge).|7. 70 year old male - Gulf County - found in debris in Cape San Blas - was fleeing in truck - ruled a drowing (surge).|8.  11 year old female ��� Seminole county, GA.

After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees.   According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available.

After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available.

After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available.

However, after approximately a week of slow development, the system moved into warm Gulf of Mexico waters and rapidly intensified into a major hurricane as it moved north towards the Florida Panhandle. After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available. There were 7 direct fatalities in the Florida panhandle and 1 direct fatality in southwest Georgia. ||1. 44 year old male - Gadsden County - died due to trauma following a tree falling on a home (wind). |2. 67 year old male - Jackson County - tree collapsed on mobile home and roof collapsed on deceased (wind). |3. 87 year old male - Bay County - house was swept away during the storm and body was found three blocks from the house (surge). |4. 79 year old female - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach - moved by storm surge (surge). |5. 60 year old female - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach - move by storm surge and found in the rubble - complications from surge and wind (given location, went with surge). |6. 65 year old male - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach rubble - moved by storm surge (surge). |7. 70 year old male - Gulf County - found in debris in Cape San Blas - was fleeing in truck - ruled a drowing (surge). |8. 11 year old female ��� Seminole county, GA.

After a 2-day long intensification period over the eastern Gulf, Michael made landfall as an unprecedented (for the region) high-end category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale in the Florida Panhandle with maximum sustained wind speed of 155 mph and a minimum pressure 919 mb. Based on wind, Michael is the fourth most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind the Labor Day Hurricane (1935), Hurricane Camille (1969) and Hurricane Andrew (1992), and the most powerful storm to impact the Florida Panhandle in recorded history.  Based on central pressure, Michael is the third most powerful hurricane to hit the United States, behind only the Labor Day Hurricane (1935) and Hurricane Camille (1969).  The storm caused catastrophic damage from wind and storm surge, particularly in the Panama City Beach to Mexico Beach to Cape San Blas areas. The widespread catastrophic damage spread well inland as Hurricane Michael remained at category 3 strength into southwest Georgia.||One of the hardest hit locations was from Mexico Beach to Indian Pass where 9 to 14 feet of peak storm surge inundation was observed. In addition, wave action caused even higher total water values and this resulted in waves destroying the second story of multiple buildings in Mexico Beach.||At St. Joseph Peninsula State Park on Cape San Blas, the storm surge cut through the peninsula, creating two inlets, resulting in portions of the park no longer being accessible by vehicle. These new inlets truly demonstrate the power of storm surge.||While preliminary peak storm surge inundation was slightly less east of Indian Pass, values were still life-threatening and caused significant damage. Along the coast, portions of U.S. 98 and Alligator Drive were washed out and had to be patched/repaved. In Carrabelle, water was high enough to enter a restaurant, resulting in damage to furniture. In addition, numerous homes along the coast were destroyed or damaged as water slammed against the structures.||In addition to the life-threatening storm surge, structural damage was extensive particularly across the Florida Panhandle. Preliminary data assessments indicate almost 50,000 structures were affected across the Florida Panhandle, western Big Bend, southwest Georgia and southeast Alabama. Of these, more than 3,000 structures were destroyed. Homes and businesses were not the only structures impacted. The Hurricane Michael Preliminary Virtual Assessment Team (P-VAT) report from the Structural Extreme Event Reconnaissance Network indicated that two hospitals in Bay County, Bay Medical Sacred Heart and Gulf Coast Regional Medical Center also sustained significant damage. One hospital had glass crack and cladding stripped off the building while the other hospital had issues with power and water. Tyndall Air Force Base (AFB), that experienced the eye of Hurricane Michael, experienced catastrophic damage with every building on base experiencing some roof damage. A nearby elementary school had a portion of its roof ripped off. During the height of the storm, before the transmission stopped, a sensor at Tyndall AFB measured a gust to 139 mph.||The wind damage was not confined to the coastline, but extended well inland. In Marianna, businesses lost their roofs and the exterior wall of some buildings collapsed as the roof was lost. In Donalsonville, GA, where a 115 mph gust was measured, roof damage was also observed and at least one silo was flipped over. Even in Albany, GA, signs were blown down and roofs were peeled off buildings.||In addition to extensive structural damage, hurricane force winds caused widespread power outages across a large portion of the tri-state region. Nearly 100% of customers across a large portion of the Florida Panhandle lost power, with some of these outages lasting weeks. These widespread power outages extended into southwest Georgia with 100% of customers losing power all the way up to Lee County, GA!||Property damage estimates were still being calculated at the time of this publication and will likely rise further from what is indicated here.  However, one estimate of insured losses from the state of Florida alone was as high as $4.2 billion with an additional $5 billion in damage to Tyndall AFB.||The catastrophic winds also resulted in damage to the timber and agricultural communities across Florida and Georgia. According to the Florida Forest Service, in Florida, timber damage costs estimates were over $1.2 billion dollars with almost 3 million acres of forested land damaged. In addition to damage costs, replanting in the more severely damaged areas could be an addition $240 million. This damage also has impacts to the wildfire potential with additional forest fuels from downed trees. |According to Florida Commissioner of Agriculture Adam Putnam, the state suffered nearly $1.5 billion in agricultural damages due to Michael. The estimated damages were as follows: Forestry $1.3 billion, Cotton $49.9 million, Cattle $43.3 million, Peanuts $23 million, Nurseries and Floriculture $16.1 million, Poultry and Eggs $10 million, Vegetables $8.6 million, Other Field Crops $7.3 million, Dairy $6.4 million, Aquaculture $5 million, Fruit $4.4 million, Tree Nuts $4.1 million, and Apiary $2 million. ||In Georgia, 2,368,226 acres of forestland was impacted by Hurricane Michael. The estimated value of this land is $762,683,909. Catastrophic damage was mainly confined to Seminole, Decatur and Miller Counties with severe damage extending into Dougherty and Terrell Counties.  Additional crop damage occurred in Georgia to cotton, vegetables, pecans, poultry, peanuts, and timber.  According to Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black, estimated damages were as follows:  Cotton $300-$900 million, Vegetables $480 million, Pecans $560 million, Poultry $25 million, Peanuts $10-$20 million, and Timber $1 billion.||Inland flooding associated with Hurricane Michael across the tri-state region was limited as the hurricane quickly tracked across the area. A maximum rainfall total of 6.84 inches was observed near Crossroads, GA (Quitman County) with the second highest amount for the region recorded in Calhoun County, FL with 6.66 inches. With these higher rainfall amounts isolated, only a few areas of inland flooding were observed. In Bay County, record flooding was observed on the Econfina Creek at State Road 20 with 26.17 feet (NAVD88). This resulted in the SR-20 bridge being overtopped. In addition, in Calhoun County, FL, moderate flooding occurred on the Chipola River near Altha. A few homes were impacted downstream from the gauge and significant damage was sustained to the fish camps along the river.  There were no recorded tornadoes across the Florida Panhandle, Big Bend, southwest Georgia or southeast Alabama associated with Hurricane Michael.||In terms of direct fatalities, the following information is available. There were 7 direct fatalities in the Florida panhandle and 1 direct fatality in southwest Georgia. ||1. 44 year old male - Gadsden County - died due to trauma following a tree falling on a home (wind). |2. 67 year old male - Jackson County - tree collapsed on mobile home and roof collapsed on deceased (wind). |3. 87 year old male - Bay County - house was swept away during the storm and body was found three blocks from the house (surge). |4. 79 year old female - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach - moved by storm surge (surge). |5. 60 year old female - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach - move by storm surge and found in the rubble - complications from surge and wind (given location, went with surge). |6. 65 year old male - Bay County - found in Mexico Beach rubble - moved by storm surge (surge). |7. 70 year old male - Gulf County - found in debris in Cape San Blas - was fleeing in truck - ruled a drowing (surge). |8. 11 year old female ��� Seminole county, GA.

A peak gust of 80 mph was recorded in neighboring Hidalgo County, a few miles southwest of the Hidalgo/Willacy County line, at 1005 PM CST July 25. ||Damage included roof, shingle, and some wall damage to several dozen homes in Raymondville, as well as damage to farm buildings on the east side of town.  100 percent of the county was without power during the peak of the storm, due to dozens of snapped or leaning power poles and downed lines.  Thousands of trees/limbs were snapped and dozens uprooted. A stadium light stanchion was ripped out of the ground by an eddy wind at Raymondville High School. Similar but lesser damage was seen in Lyford and Sebastian, where peak winds may have been closer to tropical storm force.

While there aren't many observations in Willacy County during this event, Buoy RSJT2 is just off the coastline in the Laguna Madre just north of Willacy County and can be used as a reasonable proxy. Based on the proxy observations, sustained winds likely reached near hurricane force (71 mph). With observations from RSJT2, along with radar analysis, it is reasonable to assume that portions of Willacy County experienced hurricane-force winds around 14:30 CST to 16:30 CST. ||Damage surveys revealed significant property and flora damage in Port Mansfield. |Poorly built or poorly anchored structures sustained the heaviest damage, including several flipped recreational vehicles and several partially or totally destroyed mobile trailer homes.  Near Laguna Madre, all moderately constructed homes in one neighborhood had varying damage to roofs/shingles, fences, siding, and outbuildings.  A few boat garage doors were blown out along bayside entries.  Dozens of tree limbs were blown down and several uprooted, and at least a dozen power poles were snapped or leaning along SR 186 in and near Port Mansfield.||NCEI's new report as of the end of 2020, totaled Hanna as a 1.1 billion dollar damage event, so total property damage was updated in early 2021.  Public Assistance property damage estimates, mainly due to wind, were around $127.6 thousand, and NCEI's estimate (divided among the affected counties by local storm data experts) was $59.85 million for coastal Willacy County.","Hurricane Hanna, the 2020 Atlantic season's first Hurricane, made landfall along the unpopulated Padre Island National Seashore on the mid-Kenedy County coastline as a Category 1 storm at around 5 PM Central Time Saturday, July 25th, carrying sustained 90 mph winds with gusts over 100 mph in a small portion of the inner eye wall. The hurricane spun slowly but steadily into southern Kenedy and northern Hidalgo County through just after midnight on the 26th, then through Starr County as a Tropical Storm before moving into Tamaulipas before daybreak and eventually near Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, by noon before dissipating during the evening of the 26th. Following the passage of the inner eye wall, broad feeder bands of torrential rains and gusty tropical storm force winds continued through the mid to late morning hours of July 26th, slowly migrating from east to west across the populated Rio Grande Valley. ||Other than storm surge flooding, which peaked just north of Baffin Bay on the Kleberg and Nueces County coast near Corpus Christi, Hanna's memory for the Rio Grande Valley will be flooding rainfall, power outages, and an array of damage to poorly constructed buildings, from minor roof damage to complete demolition.  Between 8 and 15 inches of rain fell from Port Mansfield to Harlingen, and along Interstate Highway 2 out through Mission and Sullivan City. The combination of high rainfall, locally high rainfall rates, and poor drainage left between 18 inches and four feet of water depth in many areas, most commonly from western Cameron through southeastern Hidalgo County, as well as a separate pocket in the Mission/La Joya/Sullivan City area.

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power.

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side.

The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County. To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable. Several roads also suffered wash outs due to the extensive flooding.|||Crenshaw County, AL: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed some trees and power lines in|the county. Significant flooding also occurred, especially in the southern half of the county. Numerous roads were impassable and some experienced washouts.||Monroe County, AL: Tropical storm conditions downed numerous trees and power lines|across Monroe county.||Clarke County, AL:  Tropical storm force winds downed trees across Clarke county. One tree|fell onto a home in Grove Hill, resulting in significant damage.||Conecuh County, AL: Tropical storm force winds downed trees and power lines in Conecuh|County.||Butler County, AL:  Tropical storm conditions downed trees and power lines across portions of Butler county. A few homes suffered minor damage from fallen trees. Scattered power outages were reported. A few roads were flooded from heavy rain.",203

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned.

To date, 1,756 structures were damaged. 44 structures were destroyed and 629 suffered major damage. Hurricane force winds resulted in siding and roof damage to many structures, with downed trees also playing a large role in damage to some|structures. Power outages were widespread. Pensacola NAS recorded sustained hurricane force winds with gusts of 92 mph. A large storm surge impacted the county, with the highest surge occurring in the Perdido Key area and along portions of Pensacola and Escambia Bays. Peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was surveyed across the northern portions of Pensacola, Escambia, and Blackwater Bays. The tidal gauge at the Port of Pensacola measured an inundation of 5.6 feet, the third highest surge ever recorded (Ivan and the 1926 hurricane are #1 and #2.) Numerous structures had significant damage from storm surge inundation. Numerous large boats and barges were moved onto land by the surge. A portion of the Three Mile bridge across Pensacola Bay collapsed due to damage from the barges. The vast majority of the storm surge structural damage occurred along the back bays and sounds and not along the immediate Gulf facing beaches. However, significant damage occurred along the Gulf islands national seashore, particularly in the Johnson Beach and Ft. Pickens area. On Johnson Beach, the surge and wave action took out a large portion of the first line of dunes with damage even noted to some of the second line dunes. 4 to 5 ft of sand covered Johnson Beach road with damage to the road itself. Noaa aerial imagery indicates that 3 new cuts were created on the far east side of Johnson Beach. The surge along the Gulf side of Perdido Key was also significant (7-9 feet) as the water line encroached upon the entrance of some of the condos and damaged walkways and pools. The copious amounts of rain (15-30 inches) also compounded the storm surge issue as water that normally would drain into area bays, rivers, creeks, and streams had nowhere to go due to the incoming storm surge. Downtown Pensacola was one notable area hard hit by this fresh water flooding, but countless other locations, especially across central and southern Escambia county, were also hard hit by this flooding. There were 3 reported fatalities, two direct and one indirect. One person died while trying to retrieve a boat during the storm and another person died while kayaking during the storm. One person died after the storm due to carbon monoxide from a generator being run indoors.||Santa Rosa County, FL: A large storm surge had its greatest impact on the sound and bay|sides of Santa Rosa county. The largest surge occurred in the northern half of Escambia Bay as well as in Blackwater and East Bay. Peak surge inundation reached 7 to 9 feet above ground level. Numerous homes suffered significant inundation from the surge. The surge flooding was compounded by 20+ inches of rain that fell which also resulted in significant to major flash flooding and river flooding. Hurricane force wind gusts also resulted in roof and siding damage to many homes, extensive downed trees, and power lines. To date, around 1,400 residential structures have been identified as being impacted with 6 being destroyed and 139 suffering major damage. 19 commercial buildings have been documented as being impacted with major damage to 4 buildings. ||Okaloosa County, FL: A long duration of tropical storm force winds impacted Okaloosa County as the center of Hurricane Sally tracked very slowly to the east and north of the county. Significant storm surge impacted coastal areas, especially in western parts of Okaloosa county closer to the Santa Rosa line. Many homes on the sound side of the Mary Esther area were inundated by the surge flooding. Portions of Highway 98 on Okaloosa Island were breached by the surge flooding, however the road was not damaged. A 2 ft seawall was breached in Ft. Walton Beach with 2 to 3 ft of water covered adjacent portions of Highway 98. Walkovers and beach side docks were displaced on the Gulf side. A few restaurants and homes suffered some flooding along Calhoun avenue, likely from a combination of the torrential rainfall and storm surge. The copious rainfall also resulted in flash flooding and major river flooding, which also flooded homes in the county.||Escambia County, AL:|Widespread trees were downed throughout Escambia county, AL. Some of the trees fell onto homes, but most of the damage was minor. However, 4 homes suffered major damage from the fallen trees. At the peak of the event, 85% of the county was without power. Torrential rainfall|of 10 to 20 inches led to flash flooding and river flooding, resulting in the 10 county roads becoming impassable during the storm. Some of the roads suffered wash outs. A couple of bridges experienced wash outs as well.||Covington County, AL:|Five homes suffered wind damage as tropical storm force winds impacted Covington county. Trees and power lines were downed which resulted in some power outages. Numerous roads were flooded and impassable. Several roads also suffered wash outs due to the extensive flooding.|||Crenshaw County, AL: Tropical storm force wind gusts downed some trees and power lines in|the county. Significant flooding also occurred, especially in the southern half of the county. Numerous roads were impassable and some experienced washouts.||Monroe County, AL: Tropical storm conditions downed numerous trees and power lines|across Monroe county.||Clarke County, AL:  Tropical storm force winds downed trees across Clarke county.

Sally produced widespread wind, storm surge, and freshwater flooding across coastal AL and the western Florida Panhandle. Flood and wind damage also extended well inland into inland southwest Alabama and south central Alabama. Sally was an extremely slow moving hurricane, which prolonged and exacerbated the local impacts. The storm was moving at less than 5 mph at the time of landfall, resulting in a long duration of tropical storm and hurricane force winds, storm surge, and torrential rainfall. ||Storm surge and resultant damage was widespread and significant from Baldwin County eastward to Okaloosa County. The highest surge occurred in the bays and sounds of Alabama and the western Florida Panhandle, with generally lower values and lesser impacts on the immediate Gulf facing shores. A peak inundation of 7 to 9 feet above ground level was officially surveyed across some locations in the back bays and sounds of southeast Baldwin County, as well as the northern end of Escambia and Blackwater Bays. A larger area was impacted by 3 to 6 feet of inundation, including along the immediate Gulf facing shores. It should be noted that the extremely heavy rainfall (more details to follow) likely exacerbated the total water levels, although it is difficult to determine the exact extent. Regardless, thousands of structures along coastal areas were flooded by the surge. ||Wind damage was extensive across the region, especially in areas that experienced the eyewall of Sally over a several hour duration. Wind damage was most extensive from southeast Mobile County eastward across Baldwin County AL into Escambia County FL. These locations experienced prolonged hurricane conditions with wind gusts over 100 mph, especially close to the immediate coast. Many homes across the area suffered roof damage from the winds and an untold number of homes were damaged by fallen trees. The tree damage was most extensive in Baldwin County, but also significant in parts of Mobile and Escambia Counties which experienced hurricane conditions. The pecan farms of Baldwin County took a major hit with well over a thousand pecan trees downed throughout the county.||The very slow movement of Sally resulted in rainfall totals of 15 to 30 inches across Baldwin County into the western Florida Panhandle. 7 to 15 inches of rain fell across parts of inland southwest Alabama, along and east of Interstate 65, and south central Alabama. This torrential rain resulted in major river and flash flooding, especially in Baldwin County eastward into the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of water rescues were conducted during the storm due to rapidly rising water and many homes were flooded. Road closures were extensive, especially in Baldwin County east into the western Florida Panhandle and some roads were damaged or washed out. Several rivers reached moderate to major flood stage and some crested within the top 5 of their historical crests. ||There were 3 direct fatalities as a result of Sally. One fatality occurred in the Wolf Bay area (Baldwin County AL.) Two men were riding the storm out on their boat and at some point during the storm attempted to swim to shore. One of the men made it to a pier and was rescued and hospitalised; the other man drowned. The second fatality occurred on Innerarity Point, FL (Escambia County FL) where a 45 year old woman drowned when the vehicle she was driving was overtaken by the incoming storm surge. The third fatality occurred in Perdido Key, FL (Escambia County FL) when a 27 year old man drowned trying to retrieve a boat that was swept away by the surge and high surf. ||There were also 3 indirect fatalities. One was due to storm cleanup in the Foley, AL area with two others (one in both Baldwin County and Escambia County FL) due to carbon monoxide poisoning from improper generator use.||The total reported damage from Public Assistance (PA) and Individual Assistance (IA) is near $550 million. Note that this does not include insured losses and damages. Also, not all county reports were available or finalized at the time of this publication. A breakdown of costs related to each individual hazard was unavailable. All damages are listed under either the Hurricane or Tropical Storm hazard, but it should be noted that a good portion of the damage was caused by storm surge or flooding even though it is not explicitly listed. ||Timber loss was extensive. The Alabama Forestry Commission estimates that 2,440 forested acres were damaged with 79,175 tons of timber destroyed at a value of $1,564,160. Most of this occurred in Baldwin County. ||A study by the University of Florida estimates that total agricultural losses in the western Florida Panhandle ranged from $55 to $100 million.||Here is a breakdown of county by county impacts:||Mobile County AL: The greatest impact of Sally in Mobile County was to Dauphin Island, which was impacted by the western eyewall of Sally for a long duration. Hurricane force winds with gusts over 100 mph were recorded on the island. Winds were out of the north, which resulted in the bay and sound side of the island being the most impacted. Several buildings experienced roof and siding damage, including to two buildings on the campus of the Dauphin Island Sea Lab. Another home on the island lost its roof entirely. A 3 to 4 foot storm surge on the north side of the island resulted in major damage to docks and piers, including at the Dauphin Island marina. Across mainland Mobile county, the southern and central portions of the county experienced a long duration of sustained tropical storm force winds with hurricane force wind gusts recorded all the way west at the Mobile Regional Airport. In fact, the 82 mph gust recorded at the airport was almost as high as the peak gust recorded in Hurricane Katrina of 83 mph. Numerous trees and power lines were downed across the county, especially in central and southern parts of the county. This resulted in widespread power outages. Mobile's Bienville Square suffered major damage to the numerous oaks in the area and there was minor damage reported at some businesses in downtown Mobile. Several homes in the county also experienced roof, siding, and fence damage. Downed trees also damaged some homes. ||Baldwin County AL: The county experienced widespread damage as the eye of Sally moved across a large portion of the county after making landfall in Gulf Shores, AL. A large|storm surge resulted in widespread inundation and major flood damage to structures along the back bay waters with little to no structural damage to buildings along the Gulf facing beaches. There was a walkway at the Cotton Bayou Gulf access that was damaged. The greatest surge occurred east of Gulf Shores across Orange Beach to the Florida State line and all the way north into the northern portion of Perdido Bay, as well as Wolf Bay. Peak inundation was surveyed to be 7 to 9 feet above ground with a much larger area that experienced 3 to 6 feet of inundation. Surge values neared 10 feet above ground at the far western end of Cotton Bayou in Orange Beach. Numerous large boats were moved onto land by the surge. Almost all piers were destroyed and several marinas were heavily damaged. The Gulf State Park Pier in Gulf Shores was also majorly damaged with a large section of the pier now missing. The 20 to 30 inches of rain that fell across the southern part of the county certainly compounded the storm surge flooding and also resulted in widespread flash flooding and river flooding. The Fish and Styx Rivers reached major flood stage and experienced their third and second highest crests respectively. The eyewall of Sally resulted in widespread and extensive damage to trees and power lines. Most of southern Baldwin county experienced sustained hurricane force winds of 75 to 85 mph with gusts over 100 mph. A sailboat anchored in Ingram Bayou measured a 1 minute sustained wind of 113 mph with a gust to 137 mph. These measurements were recorded at an elevated 58 feet. When reduced to the standard measuring height 33 feet, the sustained wind is estimated to have been 104 mph with a gust to 126 mph. The Center of Severe Weather Research recorded a 123 mph gust on the east side of the Perdido Pass bridge from an anemometer on their mobile doppler radar unit with sustained winds of 93 mph. Numerous structures were damaged by fallen trees and many structures in the county suffered significant roof and siding damage. In Ft. Morgan, a few older homes were destroyed and a boat storage facility at a marina suffered major damage. Almost all of the county lost power during the storm due to substantial damage to the power infrastructure. The pecan farming industry took a devastating hit as likely over a thousand pecan trees were destroyed across the county. There were three fatalities from the storm, one direct and two indirect. A person drowned in Orange Beach during the storm. Another fatality occurred in Foley during the post storm clean up and another individual died due to carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator.||Escambia County FL: A combination of strong wind and storm surge resulted in widespread damage to Escambia County.

High winds and storm surge left behind extensive debris, blocking roads and driveways.||Of note, 100% of homes on Kayangel (population approximately 70) had damage. All communications were lost with Kayangel during the passage of Surigae, with some restoration about 12 hours later, or late in the day on 16 April. Immediately following the passage, approximately 350 people across Koror and Kayangel were in shelters, with all 18 public schools open as storm shelters.||On the waters, the humanitarian/small cargo ship, Rim Nativa (WRN Ambassador with WFO Guam) was moored in a protected harbor in advance of the storm.

Scattered reports of trees downed and some minor structural damage due to strong winds, which surface observations indicated peaked between 65 and 75 mph along the coast, and 50 to 60 mph across inland areas. No storm-related fatalities were reported by county officials.","Hurricane Nicole made landfall near Vero Beach, Florida as a Category 1 Hurricane on Thursday, November 10, 2023 with estimated maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. The system was originally classified as a subtropical storm after forming several hundred miles east of the Bahamas before it gained tropical characteristics as it approached Grand Bahama and Abaco Island. The interplay between Nicole and an expansive area of high pressure over the eastern United States produced a large wind field of tropical storm force over the western Atlantic, with a long northeast fetch that stretched over 1000 miles. These onshore winds generated very large seas in excess of 30 feet offshore, which over multiple unusually high tide cycles, led to moderate to severe beach erosion across east central Florida.

Mawar���s prolonged northward bobble on Wednesday, 24 May spared Guam���s low-lying southeast coastline from potentially significant coastal inundation but also brought the heaviest rains and strongest winds of the southern eyewall over much of Guam.||Mawar's closest point of approach to Guam was between 08Z-10Z 24 May, as the center of Mawar���s eye passed just north of Andersen AFB and Ritidian. The southern eye may likely have come on shore, based on some accounts from AAFB.||Between 05Z and 18Z of 24 May (3 pm 24 May and 4 am 25 May), much of Guam felt the brunt of the southern eyewall. Destructive northwest winds became typhoon-force west winds soon after sunset, then increased further while turning southwest before midnight (24 May/14Z).||Ground assessments by NWS staff and unmanned aerial drone assessments by the University of Guam Drone Corps show that most damage came from the west-northwest (early winds, as Mawar���s center approached north Guam) to the southwest (after the closest point of approach, as Mawar���s center moved away from Guam).||While many trees snapped from winds of these directions, stronger trees were snapped or blown down by  west and southwest winds. TC intensity guidance pointed to an onset of rapid intensification around 12Z following the completion of the ERC.||A review of the Guam International Airport observations (PGUM) shows that the duration of tropical storm force winds, and greater (39+ mph), was nearly 14 hours���approximately from 03Z to 17Z 24 May (1 PM 24 May to 3 AM 25 May).||The highest winds recorded was on an RSOS at WFO Guam with maximum sustained winds of 91 mph with gusts to 132 mph at 2154 CHst on the 24th.

At the Guam International Airport (WFO Guam), 24.71 inches of rain was recorded during a 24-hour period from 24 May/00Z to 25 May/00Z (10 am Wednesday 5/24 to 10 am Thursday 5/25 ChST), with the bulk of this rain occurring in a 16-hour period from 04Z to 20Z 24 May (2 pm 24 May to 6 am 25 May ChST). ||A USGS rain gauge in Dededo (northern limestone plateau of Guam) recorded a rainfall rate of 6.92 inches per hour from 1145Z to 1245Z (945 p.m. to 1045 p.m. ChST) Wednesday evening, 24 May, as the southern eyewall pivoted overhead. This rain gage also recorded the highest storm total of 28.12 inches. ||While Mawar led to remarkable rainfall across Guam, it was not unprecedented: 33 inches of rain was measured during the slow passage of Typhoon Pamela in 1976. The JTWC 1976 annual report also notes that 27 inches of rain occurred during a 24-hour period during Pamela���s passage. Although there is no rainfall data during the passage of Karen (1962), historical records suggest that Mawar's 24-hour and storm total rainfall are possibly the second-greatest on record for Guam (daily data from 1945 to present).||Once to the west of Guam, Mawar steadily intensified to a peak satellite-based estimated intensity of 185 mph at 26May/03Z as noted in JTWC���s Bulletin #25. ||The center of Mawar passed very close or directly over the PacIOOS wave buoy located roughly 3 miles off of northern Guam���s Ritidian Point. The buoy measured a significant wave height of 28.97 feet at 0930Z, 24 May, with a maximum wave height of 47 feet. Between 0930Z and 1130Z, the Ritidian buoy showed a steady drop in significant|wave heights as the center of Mawar passed nearby. At 1130Z, the buoy reported a significant wave height minimum of 17.13 feet before the seas steadily rose. Sometime soon after 1430Z, the buoy stopped reporting as it broke from its mooring. Mawar���s slow westward crawl, combined with its rapid re-intensification, led to an abrupt shift and rise in west-southwest swell.||An increase in WSW swell energy led to significant coastal erosion along the western side of Guam, particularly northern Guam. The most dramatic coastal effects were noted along the northwestern Guam coastline north of Tanguisson to the western side of Ritidian Point. This is where high water marks were observed up to nearly |15 feet above the normal water level along with an erosional step 3-5 feet tall in some locations. Guam���s coastlines saw extensive erosion along all shores with salt water running up well above normal water levels due to the combination of storm surge, ocean surface wind stress, and wave action. These shore-line effects were most noted along Guam���s northwest coastline, where erosion left ���steps��� in the beach along the tree |line 3-5 feet tall and pushed debris as high as 10-14 feet above the normal water level while powerful winds stripped jungles and cliff sides of their lush vegetation.||Guam, having experienced the totality of the southern eyewall for a significant portion of the overnight hours Wednesday night into Thursday morning (24-25 May ChST), saw extensive, and in some locations, devastating damage. Nearly 100% of Guam was left without power, water and most cellular communications. One mandatory evacuation was issued for folks in low-lying coastal areas of southeast Guam with the concern of potentially devastating coastal inundation as the (then) Super Typhoon Mawar was forecast to pass just south of Guam.||Impacts ranged from moderate in the south to devastating in the north, closest to the|eye of Mawar, where the full brunt of the category 4 typhoon winds was felt. While|concrete structures received little damage, significant impacts were noted to wooden|and tin structures, particularly in northern Guam. Defoliation of trees was near 100% in|parts of central and northern Guam, except for areas that had some topographical shielding from the winds.||Some structures, including high-rise hotels, exhibited damage to facades. Across|northern Guam, numerous wood and tin structures were destroyed. Houses with concrete walls but wood or tin roofing saw extensive or complete roof failure.||While concrete power poles held firm, several wooden power poles were snapped or tilted. Throughout the island, and particularly in central and northern Guam, numerous power and communications lines were also downed.||Numerous roads were impassable due to large downed trees or other wind-blown debris, while a number of low-lying roads and those with poor drainage were impassable due to severe rain-related floodwaters.||Guam���s coastlines saw extensive erosion along all shores with salt water running up well above normal water levels due to the combination of storm surge, ocean surface wind stress, and wave action. These shore-line effects were most noted along Guam���s northwest coastline, where erosion left ���steps��� in the beach along the tree line 3-5 feet tall and pushed debris as high as 10-14 feet above the normal water level while powerful winds stripped jungles and cliff sides of their lush vegetation.||The island's last mature specimen of the critically endangered Serianthes nelsonii tree, also known as the h��yun l��gu in CHamoru, was ravaged by Typhoon Mawar. While the trunk of the tree is still rooted in the ground, the main boughs of the tree were snapped off and all that remains is a leafless wood pillar, according to a report from Marine Corps Base Camp Blaz, where the tree is located. It remains alive, but recovery |is uncertain, the reports stated. The tree, mature since the 1960s, would have survived Supertyphoon Karen in 1962, as well as typhoons Pamela, Omar, Paka and Pongsona.|Two S. nelsonii survived the storm at the University of Guam. These trees were germinated in June 2020 using seeds collected from the mature tree on Camp Blaz. About 3,000 seeds remain in storage, according to Mario Martinez, a NAVFAC Marianas natural resource specialist. With numerous pests affecting the species, they require a large amount of attention to thrive.||Although there have been no reports of injuries or deaths directly resulting from Mawar, 2 males drowned in separate swimming incidents: one having swam out to an island on the reef���s edge of central west Guam as Mawar approached and was subsequently pulled into the powerful currents; and a 2nd having entered the waters near a SW Guam marina within hours of Mawar having moved to the west of Guam and subsequently was pulled out to sea in the strong currents.","Mawar developed over the Northwest Pacific Ocean in the second half of May.

The hurricane made landfall with estimated sustained winds of 125 mph, making it a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in this portion of Florida. Hurricane Idalia moved inland across the eastern Florida Big Bend and into South Central Georgia during the morning hours. Strong winds caused extensive damage to trees, buildings, and infrastructure along a broad swath stretching west to Tallahassee and east beyond the Suwannee River. Significant and devastating storm surge accompanied the hurricane into the Taylor and Dixie County coasts, where water levels rose considerably, inundating numerous structures along the coast and flooding residences and businesses many miles inland. Significant damage to property and infrastructure was associated with the storm surge that will take a considerable time to rebuild. The peak surge values observed were from Dekle Beach in Taylor County southeastward to Horseshoe Beach in Dixie County. Surge heights in this area along the immediate coast were within the range of 7 to 12 feet above normally dry ground. Lower values of up to 6 feet above normally dry ground were noted south of Horseshoe Beach near the community of Suwannee. It should also be noted the storm made landfall around the time of low tide. Had the storm made landfall 6 hours later, around the time of high tide, peak water level values could have been between 3-4 feet higher.  In the process of the high water mark surveys, interviews were conducted with several residents that lived in the area during the Storm of the Century, a non-tropical system that affected this portion of the Florida coastline on March 13, 1993. All of these residents interviewed from Keaton Beach to Horseshoe Beach indicated water levels that rivaled or exceeded those experienced in the 1993 ���Storm of the Century.��� Moreover, Dixie County Emergency Management noted that the inland extent of the storm surge from Hurricane Idalia moved much further inland from Horseshoe Beach than observed in The Storm of the Century.

The hurricane made landfall with estimated sustained winds of 125 mph, making it a Category 3 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, the first major hurricane on record to make landfall in this portion of Florida. Hurricane Idalia moved inland across the eastern Florida Big Bend and into South Central Georgia during the morning hours. Strong winds caused extensive damage to trees, buildings, and infrastructure along a broad swath stretching west to Tallahassee and east beyond the Suwannee River. Significant and devastating storm surge accompanied the hurricane into the Taylor and Dixie County coasts, where water levels rose considerably, inundating numerous structures along the coast and flooding residences and businesses many miles inland. Significant damage to property and infrastructure was associated with the storm surge that will take a considerable time to rebuild. The peak surge values observed were from Dekle Beach in Taylor County southeastward to Horseshoe Beach in Dixie County. Surge heights in this area along the immediate coast were within the range of 7 to 12 feet above normally dry ground. Lower values of up to 6 feet above normally dry ground were noted south of Horseshoe Beach near the community of Suwannee. It should also be noted the storm made landfall around the time of low tide. Had the storm made landfall 6 hours later, around the time of high tide, peak water level values could have been between 3-4 feet higher.  In the process of the high water mark surveys, interviews were conducted with several residents that lived in the area during the Storm of the Century, a non-tropical system that affected this portion of the Florida coastline on March 13, 1993. All of these residents interviewed from Keaton Beach to Horseshoe Beach indicated water levels that rivaled or exceeded those experienced in the 1993 ���Storm of the Century.��� Moreover, Dixie County Emergency Management noted that the inland extent of the storm surge from Hurricane Idalia moved much further inland from Horseshoe Beach than observed in The Storm of the Century. One direct fatality occurred in south-central Georgia as a result of the storm.",309

Bolaven then rapidly intensified as it continued northwest and then north-northwest into the Philippine Sea, becoming a 160 mph super typhoon of Category 5 strength on Oct 11th. Bolaven would reach estimated peak intensity of 180 mph on October 12th, with a estimated minimum central pressure of 904 mb, before turning northeast on October 13th, exiting WFO Guam Area of Responsibility, and then eventually becoming an extratropical cyclone in the northern Pacific. Rota had very little data as the only observations available from Rota during this time was the COOP observers, who also serve as the observers for Rota Airport, which was closed during the storm. The 48 hour rainfall reported by the COOP observers when they returned on Oct 12th, reported 2 inches of rain. The Department of Public Safety assessed much of the island the morning after Bolaven's passage. A number of trees were down and roads were blocked. there were widespread power outages during and immediately after Bolaven's passage, but infrastructure on Rota is limited. Power was restored and roads made passable within 1-2 days.","Super Typhoon Bolaven formed in northern Chuuk State to the northeast of Chuuk Lagoon on October 7th and very slowly intensified as it moved west to west-northwest toward the Marianas.

It wasn't until October 10th that Bolaven reached Category 1 typhoon status with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph. At this point, it was located 50 miles ESE of Rota. Bolaven soon passed between the islands of Rota and Tinian, keeping the strongest of the typhoon-force winds over the open waters between the two islands, then began to rapidly intensify as it continued northwest then north-northwest into the Philippine Sea.
